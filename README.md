## Game Overview
This is a Chinese ink-style strategic matching game with various game boards and selectable difficulty levels.

Rules and instructions: Players can select a chess piece by clicking with the mouse and then choose a landing point within the displayed movable area. If there are identical chess pieces around the stopped chess piece, they can be eliminated; otherwise, this move is invalidated. Two chess pieces will be randomly generated on the board after each move. Try to achieve a higher score within a fixed amount of time!

## Job Responsibilities

Independent Development

## Design Concept

The inspiration comes from an unconventional variation of mahjong, refined into a highly strategic matching game.

## Game Mechanics

Players need to create pairs of connected tiles by moving them and eliminate them to earn points. Each move generates new tiles in empty spaces, obstructing the path.

## Game Highlights

Players must strategically plan tile movements to avoid creating irreversible blockages.
